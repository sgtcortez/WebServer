# Introduction

This project is just for educational purposes and, obvioulsy does not have a good C++ code.   
I am a beginner at c++, so, I am learning as this project evolves.  

My goals with this, is to get better in 
1. C++

    I aim to use the modern syntax with smart pointers and all the good new stuff.

2. Networking

    Get used to little endian, big endian, and networking stuff in general

3. Linux

    The system calls, some kernel data structures, IO event based mechanisms and so on

4. Object Oriented Design

    My favorite programming paradigm

For nonblocking I/O, on Linux I am using [**epoll**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html)
